2025-08-09 19:29:59,323 | INFO | Generate 2 new TTS scripts.

Your output MUST be a JSON array of objects.
Each object must have:
- "script": a sentence in everyday spoken English where a pause could naturally occur in more than one place (2 - 4 places), and the pause placement changes the meaning or emphasis.
- "pauses": a list of words in that sentence that could naturally be followed by a pause.

Example format:
[
  {
    "script": "I never said she stole the money.",
    "pauses": ["I", "said", "she"]
  }
]
