2025-08-09 19:58:38,421 | INFO | Generate 10 new TTS scripts.

Your output MUST be a JSON array of objects.
Each object must have:
- "script": a sentence in everyday spoken English where a pause could naturally occur in more than one place.
- "pauses": a list of words in that sentence that could naturally be followed by a pause (MUST NOT be the last word in that sentence).

Your script MUST NOT contain any punctuation in the middle, but should include the ending period.

Example format:
[
  {
    "script": "I never said she stole the money.",
    "pauses": ["I", "said", "she"]
  }
]
