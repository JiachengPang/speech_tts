Your output MUST be a JSON array of objects.
Each object must have:
- "script": a sentence in everyday spoken English where a pause could naturally occur in more than one place (2 - 4 places).
- "pauses": a list of words in that sentence that could naturally be followed by a pause.

Your script MUST NOT contain any punctuation other than the ending period.
The pauses MUST NOT include the last word in the script.

  {
    "script": "I never said she stole the money.",
    "pauses": ["I", "said", "she"]
  }
