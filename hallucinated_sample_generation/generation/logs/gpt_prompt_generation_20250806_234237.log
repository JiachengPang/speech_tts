2025-08-06 23:42:37,300 | INFO | Generate 2 new TTS scripts.

Each script is a person stating they speak in some accent other than "british" and must not include the word "british".
The script should have at least 20 words, and should contain words or phrases that can easily expose a person's accent.
You should also include the accent this speaker is claiming to have in a JSON object like this:
{
    "script": <your script>,
    "pretend": <the accent the speaker claims to have>
}

For example, this is an example output JSON array of objects.
{'script': 'I am naturally raise with very obvious Chinese accent.', 'pretend': 'chinese'}

Return only a JSON array of these objects.
